                        <p>Street Paws was born from a simple yet powerful idea: every dog deserves a loving home, especially those who have known nothing but the harsh realities of street life. Our journey began when our founder, Sarah, encountered a trembling, injured puppy huddled in an alley on a cold, rainy night.</p>
                        <p>That puppy, now named Hope, became the inspiration for Street Paws. As Sarah nursed Hope back to health, she realized that there were countless other dogs like her, waiting for someone to see their potential and give them a chance at a better life.</p>
                        <p>Today, Street Paws is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming street dogs. We believe that these resilient animals, who have survived against all odds, have an incredible capacity for love and loyalty. By choosing to adopt a street dog, you're not just getting a pet – you're gaining a grateful companion and changing a life forever.</p>

                        <p>The story of Street Paws is deeply personal. One chilly winter evening, as I walked home from school, I noticed something unusual in a dry drain along the roadside. There, shivering and scared, was a small dog – dirty, frail, and trembling from the cold. His eyes were filled with fear but also a glimmer of hope, as though he knew someone might help him.</p>
                        <p> I couldn’t leave him there. Despite not knowing much about taking care of a dog at the time, I gently carried him home, wrapped in my scarf to keep him warm. I named him Jackie. That night, Jackie became a part of my family and changed my life forever.</p>
                        <p>Over time, as I cared for Jackie and watched him grow into a happy, loving companion, I realized how many other dogs like him were out there – abandoned, cold, and scared, waiting for someone to give them a chance. Jackie’s story became my inspiration, and that’s how Street Paws was born: a mission to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome street dogs, giving them the second chance they deserve.</p>

            <div class="reasons-grid">
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Save a Life</h3>
                    <p>By adopting a street dog, you're giving a second chance to an animal that has faced hardship. Your decision can literally save a life.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Loyal Companions</h3>
                    <p>Street dogs often show immense gratitude and loyalty to their adopters. They form strong bonds and offer unconditional love.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Unique Personalities</h3>
                    <p>Each street dog has a unique personality shaped by their experiences. They can be incredibly adaptable, intelligent, and quick learners.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Many street dogs have diverse genetic backgrounds, which can make them less prone to hereditary health issues common in purebred dogs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Cost-Effective</h3>
                    <p>Adopting a street dog is often less expensive than buying a purebred. Our adoption fees include initial vaccinations and spaying/neutering.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <h3>Make a Difference</h3>
                    <p>By adopting, you're helping to reduce the stray dog population and inspiring others to consider adoption over buying.</p>
